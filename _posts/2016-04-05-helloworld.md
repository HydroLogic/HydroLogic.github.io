I've decided to start a blog becasue I need a place to put all my crazy code and clear my head.

Here's just a few command snippits that I am holding onto for reference sake...

* [Github Cheatsheet](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet#readme)
* [Example tutorial to help me learn how to push and pull](https://github.com/githubteacher/nicar-2015)


* Git pushes
    git add --all
    git commit -m "new notes and scripts"
    git push -u origin master

* Add a submodule to my github page
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

* For free web hosting: create a gh-pages branch:
    git checkout -b gh-pages

* Random Webpage shit
@mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile
